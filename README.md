# Physics calculator
Calculator of a ton of different scenarios in physics (or at least the physics learned in 10th grade of Norwegian schools).
You can for example calculate force from mass, starting speed, end speed, and time. 
This is done trough calculation acceleration with speed difference divided by time, and then multiplying that by mass.
It also includes functionality that lets you calculate your weight from your mass and the planet you are on.
Be aware that everything is in Norwegian, and this was written as part of Physics class in 10th grade (2020-2021).
I do not intend to change the language, so this is not very useful for those without Norwegian competence and/or a translator.
